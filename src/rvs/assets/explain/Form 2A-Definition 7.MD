# Soil and Foundation Conditions

## 2) Soil underneath liquefied
* *Liquefaction takes place when loosely packed, water-logged sediments at or near the ground surface lose their strength in response to strong ground shaking. Liquefaction occurring beneath buildings and other structures can cause major damage during earthquakes.*
* *A process during which granular soils lose their shear strength (and thereby the bearing capacity) under saturated condition when shaken by earthquake ground motion which occurs primarily in loose saturated cohesionless soils.*
