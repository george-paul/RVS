# Architecture Features and Elements 
## 2) Cracks in large, unanchored projections and overhangs
**Large overhangs and unanchored projections are highly susceptible to failure due to gravity loads. During earthquakes, the structural elements (Columns) connected to the overhangs are subjected to additional stresses. Unanchored projections and overhangs may fail and collapse during earthquakes.*
