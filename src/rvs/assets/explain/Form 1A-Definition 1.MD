##  1) Ground that has failed due to landslide or fissure

* *A fissure is a long, narrow crack opening along the surface of Earth. A ground fissure, also called an earth fissure, is a long, narrow crack or linear opening in the Earth's crust. Ground fissures can form naturally, such as from tectonic faulting and earthquakes. The structures near the fissure are susceptible to damage or collapse.*
