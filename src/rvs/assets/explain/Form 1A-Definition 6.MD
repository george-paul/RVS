# Soil and Foundation Conditions

## 6) Has uneven settlement of foundation
* *Settling is the lowering of the ground's surface that frequently occurs during earthquakes. Common causes of ground subsidence during an earthquake include consolidation or failure of the soil beneath a foundation, densification of sand and gravel layers as a result of ground shaking, and liquefaction. The uneven settlement of the ground causes one side of the foundation setlling more than the othe causing failure.*
