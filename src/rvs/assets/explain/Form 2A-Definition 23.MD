# Structural Aspects and Components 
## 8) Flat slab with 1-way punching shear cracks initiated at column
**Due to the high stress concentration at the column-to-slab connection, the most significant problem with flat slabs is their susceptibility to brittle and sudden failure. The failure is brittle in nature. The cracks iniated at columns could initiate failure and structural collapse.*
